			<question>
				<para>
					Why not use docspace or the corp wordpress site?
				</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					Docspace didnt fit our need of a true collaborative environment and did not met our publishing workflow. WordPress if anyone has worked with it will attest to it taking time to get the correct workflows happening. We decided that it would be more cost effective to write our own tool than to hack WordPress.
