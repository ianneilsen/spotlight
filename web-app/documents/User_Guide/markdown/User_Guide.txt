# Introduction

SpotLight is a tool which allows users and groups of users to collaborate and publish documents or reports to readers. The tool aims to be a specific online writing tool and archive mechanism away from other styles of blogging or wiki based applications.

The tool uses markdown and xwiki syntax which is familiar and very easy to pick-up. No complex wiki style syntax or complex formatting needed to get a good looking report or document.

Version 2.0.X allows users to create individual sites, categorize their reports/documents and share them with other users through a very simple publishing system.

SpotLight can be configured to be a multi-tenant site similar to that of SharePoint(Microsoft)

The tool is based on instiki wiki (Ruby on Rails - by creator: David Heinemeier Hansson), etherpad (by David Greenspan, Aaron Iba, and J.D. Zamfirescu) and Google Docs (by Google).


# Authentication

Spotlight uses kerberos authentication if configured and or a standalone security role based system when kerberos is disabled.
A special user and role administration system is built into SpotLight allowing an administrator to maintain users and sites.

This will close off the portfolio, but retain all the reports/documents you may have produce under it. 
    + No users will be able to see the portfolio or reports/documents

Publications
-------------

Reports and documents are known as publications in SpotLight. Publications are attached to a portfolio or site and can be shared to other users.

When creating a new publication a special edit screen is presented to you. The reports take plain text or use markdown to format the publications. A list of markdown syntax available is accessible from a markdown help screen while editing the publication.

### Create 

To create a publication you need to be granted access to the site by the portfolio administrator. Once granted access enter the portfolio from the home screen, from the portfolio profile screen, you will find a drop down button labeled **Publications**, click this and then click **Add new Publication**. A new page will open  showing a grey publication toolbar from which you can start writing your publication.

### Edit

To edit your publication enter your portfolio where you created the publication, find your publication from the publication table, click the publication name and then click the **edit** menu in the grey publication toolbar.


### Delete/Remove

To delete or remove a publication, find your publication from the portfolio site, click its name, and click the **delete** menu in the grey publication toolbar.

Alternatively you can while editing a publication also choose to delete while editing using the same **delete** menu in the grey publication toolbar.

### Publishing a publication

In order to publish a publication, you will need the security role of *Publisher*. If you do not have this security role please request it from your portfolio administrator or the application administrator.

If you do not have publishing rights your will see a field which is read-only at the top of the publication.

If you do have publishing rights, then a select list will be available to you from which you can set the *Ready for publishing* flag to **Yes**.

This will allow users outside of the portfolio to read your publication if the site is not restricted.
